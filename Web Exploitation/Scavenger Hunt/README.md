## Description

There is some interesting information hidden around this site http://mercury.picoctf.net:39698/. Can you find it?

## Hints

1. You should have enough hints to find the files, don't run a brute forcer.

## Solve

Right-click in your browser to open the Inspector. Press Source to view the source code.  
There is 1/3 of the flags in the html.

```html
		</p>
	<!-- Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t -->
      </div>
```

There is 2/3 of the flags in the mycss.css.

```css
/* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */
```

The next flag is in robots.txt.

# Part 3: t_0f_pl4c

```

The next flag is in .htaccess.

# Part 4: 3s_2_lO0k
# I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.
